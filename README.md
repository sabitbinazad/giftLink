# GiftLink - Full-Stack Web Application

## Project Description

**GiftLink** is a full-stack web application that connects users who wish to give away household items they no longer need with users who enjoy recycling and prefer to find free household items to match their taste rather than purchasing new ones. The app provides a platform for users to share and discover gifts, browse listings, and communicate with others.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Secure registration with first name, last name, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Authentication with JWT to secure access to the application.
- **Gift Listings**: Users can browse, search, and filter gift listings by category, condition, age, and more.
- **Gift Details**: View more information about a specific gift item and leave comments.
- **Profile Editing**: Edit the user's profile information, including username.
- **Logout**: Toggle between logged-in and logged-out states in the navigation bar.
